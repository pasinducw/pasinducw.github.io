I have been deeply engaged in the computer science field since 2008, first through competitive programming and innovation contests in school, leading to my professional debut in 2017. 

I co-founded [an AI interest group in 2018](https://the-ai.team), which grew into a thriving business. As the engineering lead, I've spearheaded the development of over 15 software solutions. My academic background includes research in music audio identification using recurrent autoencoder networks. 

My career reflects a strong inclination towards solving challenging problems across various domains.
